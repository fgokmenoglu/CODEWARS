Checkerboard Resolution
In this kata we will be counting the the black squares on a special checkerboard. It is special because it has a resolution which determines how the black and white squares are laid out.

The resolution refers to the dimensions of squares of a single colour. See below for an example with dimensions 11x6:

With resolution = 1:
Number of black squares = 33

And now with resolution = 2:
Number of black squares = 32

And one more example, resolution = 5:
Number of black squares = 31

As you may have noticed the top left square is always white, and we are counting the individual black squares on the board.

Task
You are required to write a function that will take in three parameters:

width -> The width of the board
height -> The height of the board
resolution -> The size of the coloured squares on the checkerboard (as shown above)
And returns the total count of all individual black squares.

Additional Info
All inputs will be valid
0 <= width <= 10**32
0 <= height <= 10**32
1 <= resolution <= 10**32
